x Using Ruby on Rails for the project
x Include at least one has_many relationship (x has_many y e.g. User has_many Recipes)
x Include at least one belongs_to relationship (x belongs_to y e.g. Post belongs_to User)
x Include at least one has_many through relationship (x has_many y through z e.g. Recipe has_many Items through Ingredients)
X The "through" part of the has_many through includes at least one user submittable attribute (attribute_name e.g. ingredients.quantity)
X Include reasonable validations for simple model objects (list of model objects with validations e.g. User, Recipe, Ingredient, Item)

 X Include signup (how e.g. Devise)
 X Include login (how e.g. Devise)
 X Include logout (how e.g. Devise)
 Include third party signup/login (how e.g. Devise/OmniAuth)
 X Include nested resource show or index (URL e.g. users/2/recipes)
 X Include nested resource "new" form (URL e.g. recipes/1/ingredients)
 Include form display of validation errors (form URL e.g. /recipes/new)
Confirm:

 X The application is pretty DRY
 X Limited logic in controllers
 X Views use helper methods if appropriate
 X Views use partials if appropriate

Must render at least one index page (index resource - 'list of things') via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend.
Must render at least one show page (show resource - 'one specific thing') via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend.
Your Rails application must reveal at least one `has-many` relationship through JSON that is then rendered to the page.
Must use your Rails application to render a form for creating a resource that is submitted dynamically through JavaScript.
At least one of the JS Model Objects must have a method on the prototype.
